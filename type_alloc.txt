GoLang determines whether to allocate a variable on the stack or the heap through a process called "escape analysis", which is performed by the compiler during compilation.

-- Stack Allocation: 
If the Go compiler can determine that a variable's lifetime is confined to the scope 
of the function in which it's declared, meaning it will not be referenced after the 
function returns, it will be allocated on the stack. This is efficient because stack 
allocations are fast and automatically deallocated when the function exits.

-- Heap Allocation: 
If the compiler determines that a variable "escapes" the local scope of its 
function, meaning it might be referenced after the function returns, it will be 
allocated on the heap. 
Examples of scenarios where a variable escapes include:  
- Returning a pointer to a local variable from a function. 
- Storing a local variable in a global variable or a data structure accessible 
from outside the function. 
- Passing a pointer to a local variable to another goroutine.

-- p.s.
Stack allocations are generally faster than heap allocations, as they involve 
simple pointer manipulations. Heap allocations require more complex memory 
management, including garbage collection. The Go compiler aims to allocate on 
the stack whenever possible for performance reasons.
